## How it works?
It opens a specific link in a new borderless chromium browser window. It works on any chromium based browsers, I dont know if it works with firefox. </br>

## How to use?
First of all you need to move these files to your /usr/bin if you are using dmenu.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PTrixi/socialmedia-apps.git
cd socialmedia-apps
sudo mv instagram whatsapp pinterest /usr/bin
```
</br>
Now that you moved the files, you can change the line that says brave to whatever chromium browser you want. Also you can change the website link to whatever website you want to open in borderless mode.
